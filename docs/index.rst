.. PyDynamic_tutorials' documentation master file, which we copied heavily from the
   docs of https://github.com/cornellius-gp/gpytorch, because we liked so
   much the way they presented their tutorials, examples and actual
   documentation of the code side by side.

PyDynamic_tutorials - Assistance in understanding uncertainty propagation with PyDynamic
========================================================================================

*PyDynamic_tutorials* is a collection of tutorials based on Jupyter notebooks which are
designed to simplify the handling of PyDynamic. The tutorials range from introductory
examples to more in-depth use cases in the context of `our work at PTB <https://www
.ptb.de/cms/en/ptb/ptb-management/pstab/pst-1-coordination-digitalization.html>`_.

For the *PyDynamic_tutorials* homepage go to
`GitHub <https://github.com/PTB-PSt1/PyDynamic_tutorials>`_.

*PyDynamic_tutorials* are written in Python 3.
